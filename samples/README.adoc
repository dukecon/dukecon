= Test HTTP/REST requests

If you want to test DukeCon endpoints in different environments, i.e.., on _localhost_, on one of the _staging_
environments, or even one of the _production_ environments, you will find some executable tests and environment
definitions here.

== Test execution

These tests can be directly executed in IntelliJ. The IDE provides build in REST or HTTP client. The Client will allow
to execute one of the test cases directly and choose one of the environments defined in link:rest-client.env.json[].
